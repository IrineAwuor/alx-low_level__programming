# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to <a href = "https://fs.blog/feynman-learning-technique/">explain to anyone,</a> without the help of Google:

# General
* What is a search algorithm
* What is a linear search
* What is a binary search
* What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

# More Info

You will be asked to write files containing big O notations. Please use this format:

* O(1)
* O(n)
* O(n!)
* n*m -> O(nm)
* n square -> O(n^2)
* sqrt n -> O(sqrt(n))
* log(n) -> O(log(n))
* n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
